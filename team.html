Currently, a postdoctoral fellow at the IUGM, University of Montreal, under the supervision of Dr. Pierre Bellec, Dr. Badhwar primarily uses fMRI data to study Alzheimer’s disease and to determine how aspects of brain connectivity could be developed as biomarkers of progression in Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Badhwar was the recipient of a post-doctoral fellowship from the Alzheimer's Society of Canada (2015-2017), and a CIHR post-doctoral fellow since 2017. Dr. Badhwar is also involved in public outreach through her artistic works where the topics of brain organization, plasticity, and memory are recurrent.

In all, he spent about ten years studying the evolution and seismology of white dwarfs and solar like stars. He followed this period with a two years stint in the film industry, working has a Technical Director in the dynamic CGI production environment in downtown Montréal. It is with this eclectic background, always lined with high performance computing, that Dr Quirion joined the SIMEXP lab for two years (2016-18) as a research professional. There, he developed software for MRI image analysis and distributed computing both on bare metal clusters and with the CBRAIN portal. Since early 2018, he joined Compute Canada and Genome Québec, where he keeps working on scientific workflows for high performance computing.
